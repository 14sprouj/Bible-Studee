                    <p>Hi there. Welcome to my blog. Here I will share with you my 'Spiritual Diary'. I will try and make every entry apply to you. I'm not sure what else to say except read on and enjoy.</p>

                    <p>This week I was anxious of death and the afterlife. Today I started worrying that I wasn't saved. My mum reminded me of this Bible verse.</p>
                    <bible><i>Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</i> Romans 10 v 13</bible>
                    <p>Please note
                        <orange>not may but SHALL</orange>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <pink>I need to surrender my life to Him.</pink>As humans, however, we do not like to be dependent on others, especially someone we can't even see. But it is essential to trust him because we can not be forgiven without complete trust
                        in him.</p>
                    <p>
                        <yellow>We must trust that our lives are part of a big picture.</yellow>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <orange>If he asks us to do something we must do it immediately.</orange>
                    </p>
                    <p>When we die our body is pointless because our souls are no longer in it. Our body’s sole purpose is to allow us to prepare. Once we have left earth, it will never be needed again because in heaven we will receive a perfect body.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>What about now?</u>
                        <br>The Bible tells us that we need to look after our body in 1 Corinthians 3 v 16-17. “Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst? If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy
                        that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.” God wants to live within you, so why destroy yourself. Do everything in your power to keep yourself healthy and well.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition we must listen to and obey God. We often ask God to do lots of things for us. We do a lot of talking, but how much listening do we do? <a href="#listen" class="shown">Read about listening to God here.</a>
                    </p>
                    
                    <prayer> Heavenly Father, help me to remember your love and mercy for me. Forgive me, I pray. Guide me please. Let me be willing to open up my heart to you. I surrender my life to you. I ask that you will help me to never be hesitant to do as you ask. Amen.</prayer>

                    <p>This week I was anxious of death and the afterlife. I spoke to my mum who told me a story…</p>
                    <p class="groove">There was once a seed that was growing up with his friends underground. Then one day, one of the seeds had gone. In it’s place was a green stem going above the ground. But the seeds could only see the empty shell. The seed’s friends
                        were sad because they could not talk to him again. But above ground, the seed had become a beautiful flower for all to see and admire.</p>
                    <p>In a similar way, the whole point of being of earth is to prepare for going to heaven. The whole purpose of a seed is to get the nutrients it needs later. You could think of it like this:</p>
                    <p class="groove">Alex was preparing to go on holiday to another country. Before he left, he needed to prepare. He needed to pack all the essentials. If he had forgotten his passport, he wouldn’t be allowed in the country.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, we must prepare before we leave this world or we will not be allowed in heaven. Life on earth prepares us for death and heaven.</p>
                    <p>When we die our body is pointless because our souls are no longer in it. Our body’s sole purpose is to allow us to prepare. Once we have left earth, it will never be needed again because in heaven we will receive a perfect body.
