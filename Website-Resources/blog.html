                    <p> At the age of about 33, God's only son, Jesus was arrested and charged with blasphemy and sedition. Blasphemy is when someone uses God's name in vain or says that they are God. Sedition is defined as "conduct or speech inciting people to rebel against the authority of a state". The Romans were concerned that Jesus would start a riot so they decided to crucify him. This was a common punishment for these crimes.</p>

                    <p class="bible"><i> “Pilate wanted to please the crowd, so he freed Barabbas for them. After having Jesus beaten with whips, he handed Jesus over to the soldiers to be crucified. The soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s palace (called the Praetorium) and called all the other soldiers together. They put a purple robe on Jesus and used thorny branches to make a crown for his head. They began to call out to him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” The soldiers beat Jesus on the head many times with a stick. They spit on him and made fun of him by bowing on their knees and worshiping him. After they finished, the soldiers took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him out of the palace to be crucified. A man named Simon from Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was coming from the fields to the city. The soldiers forced Simon to carry the cross for Jesus. They led Jesus to the place called Golgotha, which means the Place of the Skull. The soldiers tried to give Jesus wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he refused. The soldiers crucified Jesus and divided his clothes among themselves, throwing lots to decide what each soldier would get. It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified Jesus. There was a sign with this charge against Jesus written on it: THE KING OF THE JEWS. They also put two robbers on crosses beside Jesus, one on the right, and the other on the left. [ And the Scripture came true that says, “They put him with criminals.”] People walked by and insulted Jesus and shook their heads, saying, “You said you could destroy the Temple and build it again in three days. So save yourself! Come down from that cross!” The leading priests and the teachers of the law were also making fun of Jesus. They said to each other, “He saved other people, but he can’t save himself. If he is really the Christ, the king of Israel, let him come down now from the cross. When we see this, we will believe in him.” The robbers who were being crucified beside Jesus also insulted him. At noon the whole country became dark, and the darkness lasted for three hours. At three o’clock Jesus cried in a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani.” This means, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, “Listen! He is calling Elijah.” Someone there ran and got a sponge, filled it with vinegar, tied it to a stick, and gave it to Jesus to drink. He said, “We want to see if Elijah will come to take him down from the cross.” Then Jesus cried in a loud voice and died. The curtain in the Temple was torn into two pieces, from the top to the bottom. When the army officer who was standing in front of the cross saw what happened when Jesus died, he said, “This man really was the Son of God!””</i> Mark‬ ‭15:15-39‬ ‭NCV‬‬ </p>
                    <p>After being sentenced to crucifixion this is what happened:
<ol>
<li><div class="tooltip"> He was "flogged with a lead-tipped whip" <span class="tooltiptext">Mark 15 Verse 15</span></div> </li>
<li>He was dressed in a purple robe and a "crown" of thorns</li>
<li>He was mocked and taunted</li>
<li>He was hit on the head with a stick</li>
<li>He was spat on</li>
<li>People bowed down to him in mock worship</li>
</ol>
Then he was offered a drug to help numb the pain but he refused it so he could feel all the pain.
</p>
                    <p>
                        <pink>I need to surrender my life to Him.</pink> As humans, however, we do not like to be dependent on others, especially someone we can't even see. But it is essential to trust him because we can not be forgiven without complete trust
                        in him.</p>
                    <p>
                        <yellow>We must trust that our lives are part of a big picture.</yellow>

                    </p>
                    <p>When we die our body is pointless because our souls are no longer in it. Our body’s sole purpose is to allow us to prepare. Once we have left earth, it will never be needed again because in heaven we will receive a perfect body.
                    </p>

                    <p><u>What about now?</u>
                        <br>The Bible tells us that we need to look after our body in 1 Corinthians 3 v 16-17. “Don’t you know that you yourselves are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in your midst? If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy
                        that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and you together are that temple.” God wants to live within you, so why destroy yourself. Do everything in your power to keep yourself healthy and well.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition we must listen to and obey God. We often ask God to do lots of things for us. We do a lot of talking, but how much listening do we do? <a href="#listen" class="shown">Read about listening to God here.</a>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="prayer"> Heavenly Father, help me to remember your love and mercy for me. Forgive me, I pray. Guide me please. Let me be willing to open up my heart to you. I surrender my life to you. I ask that you will help me to never be hesitant to do as you ask. Amen.</p>

                    <p>This week I was anxious of death and the afterlife. I spoke to my mum who told me a story…</p>
                    <p class="groove">There was once a seed that was growing up with his friends underground. Then one day, one of the seeds had gone. In it’s place was a green stem going above the ground. But the seeds could only see the empty shell. The seed’s friends
                        were sad because they could not talk to him again. But above ground, the seed had become a beautiful flower for all to see and admire.</p>
                    <p>In a similar way, the whole point of being of earth is to prepare for going to heaven. The whole purpose of a seed is to get the nutrients it needs later. You could think of it like this:</p>
                    <p class="groove">Alex was preparing to go on holiday to another country. Before he left, he needed to prepare. He needed to pack all the essentials. If he had forgotten his passport, he wouldn’t be allowed in the country.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, we must prepare before we leave this world or we will not be allowed in heaven. Life on earth prepares us for death and heaven.</p>
                    <p>When we die our body is pointless because our souls are no longer in it. Our body’s sole purpose is to allow us to prepare. Once we have left earth, it will never be needed again because in heaven we will receive a perfect body.
